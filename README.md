# ProjectZETA
This is a new project I wanted to try. I have started developing a new app that captions images in real time.




## Deployment

To deploy this project, first get an api key from https://huggingface.co. 

Then download the latest release and add your api key in the "API KEY" variable.

After that download all the libraries required.

(LIBRARY FILE PRIVIDED IN THE FIRST RELEASE)

Then its as simple as running the program.

```python3 ./main.py```
